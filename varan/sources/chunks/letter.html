                            I have been passionate about the computer games since the age of 10, starting with my first Commodore 116 then Atari 800XL and later PCs and I have carried through with this passion until adulthood. <br>Over the years it allowed me to absorb the different intricacies introduced in the various, highly marketed game brands and their products.  
                            <br>Until now I have been working in business travel industry and it gave me the ability to work under the time pressure and expanded my concentration, perceptivity and accuracy skills as well as my teamwork attitude. 
                            <br>I think my experience in travel industry is on the highest level. 
                            <br>I know Amadeus and Galileo GDS which give me the ability to work directly in Airlines' systems, having full controll over the reservations.
                            <br>I always take care of the travellers, guiding them all thru the journey in case of irregularities - cancelled or delayed flights, problems in hotels or car rental companies.
                            <br>Now - as a person who likes new challenges, I would like to connect those interests into the career and work for the computer industry using my knowledge of business trip arrangement.  
                            <br>Aside from my good communication skills, perfect knowledge of my native language, fluency in English both written and spoken and ability to work with the team, I am very particular to the details that make your business trip as smooth as possible.   
                            <br>I have also finished the HTML, CSS and javascript course and I learned angular myself.
                            <br> 
                            <br>I believe I would be a valuable addition to your team and I really want to work for you. 
                            <br>Looking forward to hearing from you.
