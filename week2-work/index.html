				Woo-hoo! You get to do some coding! Exciting! 
				Time to complete: 1-2 hours. 
				It may take you less time than that 
				if you've absorbed the material in this module well. 
				Ask questions in Discussions if you get stuck! 
				We are all learning, and going through getting stuck 
				and then unstuck (even with someone's help) 
				can be a very valuable learning experience! 
				Don't get scared by the number of points below. 
				It's really not so much. I just wanted 
				to explain everything as clearly 
				as I could and break it down into smaller steps.
